# Dash_InfinitiG37

This repo contains a Vehicle Plugin for [Dash](https://github.com/OpenDsh/dash/) to support a 2011 InfinitiG37.

Current functionality:

* Automatic day/night theme switching based on the headlight status of the car
* HVAC/Climate Integration (read only)



It is likely that this plugin works with other years of G37, or even across the Nissan/Infiniti lines. However I make no garuntees.
